# üõ°Ô∏è Kryptos-styled Vigenere Cipher Tool
This is a simple encryption and decryption tool inspired by the first section of the Kryptos sculpture at CIA headquarters.
It uses a classical Vigenere cipher, allowing users to encode and decode messages with a custom key.

- Only alphabetic characters are encrypted (punctuation, numbers and spaces are preserved)
- All text is converted to lowercase during processing
- No external libraries are needed

This project was built to help me understand how classical ciphers like the Vigenere work at a basic level.
