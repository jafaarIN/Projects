# Electromagnetic Side-Channel Leakage of Analogue CCTV Signals

- This project explores the feasibility of reconstructing CCTV footage from leaked EM data given off by analogue wired CCTV cameras (CVBS over coax).
- Such cameras unintentionally radiate its video signals as electromagnetic side-channels. By tuning an SDR and processing the captured IQ data, it's possible to reconstruct recognisable image frames from the CCTV feed.
- The goal is to create a tablet, that when in proximity with a wired CVBS CCTV camera system, picks up Electromagnetic side-channel leakage; wherefrom it then compiles the CCTV's camera feed.
