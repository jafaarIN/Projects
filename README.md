# ðŸŽ¨ðŸ”¨ My Coding Projects

This repository contains all the coding projects I have built (starting from this documentation's inception) or in the process of building; from small tools and scripts to full apps and experiments. Each project is self-contained in its own folder with its own 'README.md'.

I use this repository to:
- Practice applying what I learn in real projects
- Explore new languages and libraries
- Build upon my skillset and ultimately expand my programming knowledge
